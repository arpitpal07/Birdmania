            <img src="softbirds.webp" alt="softbirds">
            <p>Softbirds are small, delicate birds known for their gentle nature, soft plumage, and calming presence. Often found in quiet gardens, woodlands, or meadows, these birds bring a sense of peace with their light movements and soothing songs. Their feathers are typically smooth and fluffy, making them appear especially gentle and inviting. Softbirds play an important role in their ecosystems by spreading seeds and controlling insect populations, all while enchanting birdwatchers with their subtle beauty and serene behavior.</p>
            <h1>BIRDS OF PREY</h1>
            <img src="prey.jpeg" alt="preybirds">
            <p>Birds of prey, also known as raptors, are powerful birds that hunt and feed on other animals. They are equipped with keen eyesight, sharp talons, and strong, hooked beaks to catch and kill their prey. Common examples include the eagle, known for its strength and majestic flight; the hawk, which is agile and quick; the falcon, famous for its speed and precision; and the owl, a nocturnal hunter with excellent night vision and silent flight. These birds play a vital role in ecosystems by helping to control populations of rodents and other small animals.</p>
            <h1>Water Birds</h1>
            <img src="water.jpeg" alt="waterbirds">
            <p>Water birds are birds that live in or around water and are specially adapted for swimming, diving, or wading. They are commonly found in lakes, rivers, marshes, ponds, and coastal areas. Most water birds have webbed feet for swimming, waterproof feathers, and long legs or bills suited for catching fish, insects, or plants. Some are excellent divers, while others float on the surface or walk through shallow water. Examples include the duck, known for its waddling walk and floating ability; the swan, graceful and powerful in water; the goose, a strong swimmer and flier; the pelican, with its large throat pouch for catching fish; and the grebe, a diving bird with lobed toes. Water birds play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are a joy to watch in natural settings.</p>
            <h1>Wading Birds</h1>
            <img src="bg.webp" alt="wadingbirds">
            <p>Wading birds are a group of birds commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and shallow waters, where they search for food by wading through water. They usually have long legs for walking in water, long necks, and pointed beaks for catching fish, insects, and small aquatic creatures. Examples of wading birds include the heron, egret, stork, and ibis. These birds are specially adapted to their watery environments and play an important role in maintaining the balance of wetland ecosystems by controlling insect and fish populations.</p>
            <h1>Flightless Birds</h1>
            <img src="flightless.jpg" alt="Flightlessbirds">
            <p>Flightless birds are birds that have evolved without the ability to fly, often due to adaptations to life on the ground or in water. Despite their lack of flight, many are strong runners, swimmers, or divers. These birds typically have small or underdeveloped wings and strong legs. Some well-known examples include the ostrich, the largest and fastest-running bird; the penguin, which uses its wings to swim instead of fly; the emu, native to Australia; and the kiwi, a small, nocturnal bird from New Zealand. Flightless birds show how animals can adapt in different ways to survive in their environments.</p>
            <h1>Game Birds</h1>
            <img src="game.jpeg" alt="gamebirds">
            <p>Game birds are land-dwelling birds that are often raised or hunted for sport and food, but many also thrive in the wild. They typically have stout bodies, short wings, and are strong runners. These birds usually feed on seeds, insects, and plants. Common examples include the pheasant, with its bright plumage; the quail, small and fast-moving; the partridge, often found in grasslands; and the wild turkey, native to North America. Game birds are also important in rural cultures and ecosystems for seed dispersal and insect control.</p>
            <h1>Parrots</h1>
            <img src="parrot.jpeg" alt="parrots">
            <p>Parrots are highly intelligent and social birds, famous for their bright feathers, curved beaks, and ability to imitate human speech and sounds. They are usually found in tropical and subtropical regions, including rainforests and woodlands. Parrots form strong bonds with their mates and often live in flocks. Popular species include the colorful macaw, the playful parakeet (budgerigar), the expressive cockatoo, and the clever African grey parrot, one of the best talkers in the bird world. Parrots play a vital role in forests by spreading seeds and pollinating flowers</p>
            <h1>shorebirds</h1>
            <img src="shore.jpeg" alt="shorebirds">
            <p>Shorebirds are birds that live along coastlines, mudflats, and freshwater or saltwater wetlands. They have long legs for wading and slender beaks adapted to probe mud or sand for insects, worms, and small shellfish. Many are migratory and travel thousands of miles each year between breeding and feeding grounds. Examples include the sandpiper, known for its quick movements; the plover, often seen running along beaches; the curlew, with its long curved bill; and the oystercatcher, which feeds on mollusks with its strong beak.</p>
            <h1>tropicalbirds</h1>
            <img src="tropical.jpg" alt="tropical">
            <p>Tropical birds inhabit warm, lush regions such as rainforests and tropical islands. They are often known for their dazzling colors, unique calls, and fascinating courtship behaviors. These birds depend on the rich biodiversity of tropical ecosystems for food, shelter, and breeding. Examples include the toucan, with its oversized, colorful beak; the hornbill, which nests in tree cavities; the exotic bird of paradise, famous for its dance displays; and the hummingbird, a tiny, fast-flapping bird that feeds on nectar. Tropical birds are key pollinators and seed dispersers in their habitats.</p>

            <img src="pigeons and dove.jpeg" alt="pigeons and dove">
            <p>Pigeons and doves are closely related birds that are found almost everywhere in the world, from cities to forests. They are known for their soft cooing sounds, graceful flight, and ability to find their way home over long distances. These birds have a gentle appearance, with rounded bodies and small heads. The rock pigeon is common in urban areas and has even been used in war to carry messages. The mourning dove is named for its sad, whistling call, and the white dove is a universal symbol of peace and love. They play a role in seed dispersal and are often seen feeding on the ground.</p>
